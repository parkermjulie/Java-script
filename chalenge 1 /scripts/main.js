it should show that it goes from 1 (lmln)
it should show the current value and remove the old value*/

//SECOND CURRENT ATMOSPHERE
/* make an array with texts of each of the atmosphere layers
it should go from the [0] to [5] and then stop
it should show text not numbers
it should should show either all the values and the value now(true)would become bigger in size (font) and others will stay as they were in size (font)


//THIRD FUEL LEFT--> add too high too low becomes dengarous/ alert message if it reaches a certain value /true or false/ change the colour font /interact with numbers , combination of two numbers 
should start at 1,892,705 (liters)- write the word liters
then it should go by 10 liters decreasing until it will reach 0 (or false)
